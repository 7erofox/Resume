                    <p class="description"> During my one year internship, I was fortunate to be placed on the Platform Analytics team, which builds and maintains the data pipeline. The majority of my role here was spent working with Python and GraphQL via Datahub, pulling data from Snowflake, and presenting data through grafana. Among other things, I built web scrapers, employee management programs, failure monitoring and alerting scripts, and automating security compliance operations which were previously manual.
                        I found here that I have a deep interest in SQL, and simple, elegant query based solutions. I gained expsoure to Kubernetes, Terraform, Spark, Flink and much of the AWS suite. I spent my first month or two fixing bugs, and my last with an emphasis on testing.</p>

						<span class="field">Homestead management system</span> <span class="date">May 2024 - Present</span>
					</div>
					<p class="description">Avocadish.xyz is a project run by my partner and me, written in Go and Python. The git repo is hosted on sourcehut. We live in a tiny house, off the grid, and use this project to monitor our solar input and output, and subsequently manage it, make blog posts about our life in the hopes of providing folks information about tiny and sustainable living, and host any of our random projects. Most recently for Avocadish, I have written a Python program to automate pulling weather data from the local area, then storing it in a SQLite database. This will be used to cross reference data from vegetable, fruit, nut and flower yields from our land, to see which produce does better in certain conditions, especially given the increasingly unpredictable seasons lately.</p>

					<h3 class="title">Pomodoro App</h3>
					<div class="meta">
					</div>
					<p class="description">A really basic bash script to run a pomodoro app in my terminal when I need to focus. I spend a lot of time in my terminal when programming, and sometimes when I want to do deep work, I disable my wifi and put my phone on aeroplane mode to prevent further distraction. Having a pomodoro timer running in my terminal means that I don't need either of these things, or bloated clock apps, in order to set a timer.</p>

					<h3 class="title">Resume website</h3>
					<div class="meta">
					</div>
					<p class="description">A website to host and easily update my work experience and programming projects, written in HTML. This prevents me needing to use bloated, complicated or expensive tools in order to update and share my resume with friends, colleagues or potential future employers.</p>
