        <p>
          An early stage software engineer with an interest in sustainable
          programming practices, data analysis and lucid solutions. Primary
          experience is in Python, Ruby and SQL, with exposure to Go, Java and
          C.

        <h4>Rapid 7</h4>
        <h5>Software Engineering Intern 2023 - 2024</h5>
        <p>
          Software Engineering Intern June 2023 - May 2024 During my one year
          internship, I was fortunate to be placed on the Platform Analytics
          team, which builds and maintains the data pipeline. The majority of my
          role here was spent working with Python and GraphQL via Datahub,
          pulling data from Snowflake, and presenting data through grafana.
          Among other things, I built web scrapers, employee management
          programs, failure monitoring and alerting scripts, and automating
          security compliance operations which were previously manual. I found
          here that I have a deep interest in SQL, and simple, elegant query
          based solutions. I gained expsoure to Kubernetes, Terraform, Spark,
          Flink and much of the AWS suite. I spent my first month or two fixing
          bugs, and my last with an emphasis on testing.

        <h3>Personal projects</h3>
        <h4>Spooky Spices [Ongoing]</h4>
        <a href="https://spookyspices.com">Spookyspices</a>
        <p>
          A recipe website used primarily for personal reference. I include
          recipes for favourite meals, or those I don't want to struggle to find
          in many years. I also include recipes for shampoo bars, toothpaste,
          and a number of food guides and information.
        </p>

        <h4>Avocadish [Ongoing]</h4>
        <p>
          Avocadish.xyz is a project run by my partner and me, written in Go and
          Python. The git repo is hosted on sourcehut. We live in a tiny house,
          off the grid, and use this project to monitor our solar input and
          output, and subsequently manage it, make blog posts about our life in
          the hopes of providing folks information about tiny and sustainable
          living, and host any of our random projects. Most recently for
          Avocadish, I have written a Python program to automate pulling weather
          data from the local area, then storing it in a SQLite database. This
          will be used to cross reference data from vegetable, fruit, nut and
          flower yields from our land, to see which produce does better in
          certain conditions, especially given the increasingly unpredictable
          seasons lately.
        </p>

        <h4>Glucose/Mood tracker</h4>
        <p>
          A python program which runs once a day. I input data around which
          habits I have implemented in my day to reduce insulin spikes, and my
          overall mood for that day. This information is stored in a database.
          In the future, I am interested in adding more fields to this and
          correlating the data with a continuous glucose monitor.
